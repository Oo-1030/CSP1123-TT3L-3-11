# Start
(Max spawns in MMU Hostel Building 2[HB2].)
Max : Hmmm, interesting rumors. I want to find out the legendary senior, X and get the secret which can get 4.0 on assignment easily. With this secret, my college life will be hassle-free. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH.
(Max walked toward the stairs and saw a fat guy.)
Fat guy : Wait, I know you are finding X. Right?
Max : WHAT? How you know that.
Fat guy : OH. You're talking to yourself so loudly over there, I can hear you from here.
Max : ......Ok find. What you want to do?
Fat guy : As a senior who started one semester earlier than you, let me teach you how to fight others.
Max : Fight? Why I need to learn it?
Fat guy : Nah, if you can get the info easily, that will be very boring.
Max : Can I just use money power to get it.
Fat guy : That’s also the necessary way for you to obtain the info about X. By the way, do you have a lot of money.
Max : NAH.
Fat guy : Don’t worry, fighting others will help you earn more money.
Max : Is that legal?
Fat guy : For sure. Everyone's agreeing willingly, so how could it be illegal?
Max : As long as it's legal, that's fine.
Fat guy : No time to waste, let's begin the fight!
(Get inside fighting tutotial.)
