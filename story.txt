# Intro
Max is a foundation freshman exploring his new school, Multimedia University. 
During the WIN week, Max has heard from people around about a legendary senior, X, who has a secret that allows people to get a 4.0 GPA on assignments easily. 
Max is very interested in this and decide to find this senior, X, and get his secret.
Currently, Max learned from others that there are four main characters, all of whom are teammates of X on the assignment.
Fazir at the Haji Tapah.
Rane at the Learning Point.
Edeline at the Faculty of Computing & Informatics (FCI) building.
Elves at the Dewan Tun Canselor (DTC).
Max needs to find them and gets info about X from them.

# Start
(Max spawns in MMU Hostel Building 2[HB2].)
Max : Hmmm, interesting rumors. I want to find out the legendary senior, X and get the secret which can get 4.0 on assignment easily. With this secret, my college life will be hassle-free. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH.
(Max walked toward the stairs and saw a fat guy.)
Fat guy : Wait, I know you are finding X. Right?
Max : WHAT? How you know that.
Fat guy : OH. You're talking to yourself so loudly over there, I can hear you from here.
Max : ......Ok find. What you want to do?
Fat guy : As a senior who started one semester earlier than you, let me teach you how to fight others.
Max : Fight? Why I need to learn it?
Fat guy : Nah, if you can get the info easily, this "GAME" will be very boring.
Max : What you mean this "GAME"? 
Fat guy : ......
Max : ......
Fat guy :Fighting others will help you earn money. Money is essential for acquiring more info about X.
Max : Is that legal?
Fat guy : For sure. Everyone's agreeing willingly, so how could it be illegal?
Max : As long as it's legal, that's fine.
Fat guy : No time to waste, let's begin the fight!
(Get inside fighting tutorial.)

(Tutorial end.)
Fat guy : I have nothing more to teach you. From here on, you'll have to walk the path on your own.
Max : Although it’s all a bit strange, thank you anyway. But—who are you, and why did you teach me all this?
Fat guy ：I’m just a senior who happened to pass by—once, I walked the same path as you, in search of X.
Max : Wait, you already know who is X? Why won’t you just tell me who X is, and what the secret is?
Fat guy : Didn't I already say? That would make this "GAME" way too boring.
Max : ......Ok, bye.
Fat guy : Farewell. May you overcome all the challenges that lie ahead. Now, you need to find the first person, Fazir at Haji Tapah.

(Exploring.)
On the road, Max encountered an NPC and engaged in battle.
Max passed by Tekun Mart and did a gacha pull inside. 
Max got an item that increases his luck stat.
A Tekun store employee stands outside the shop with a blank expression.
Max arrived at Haji Tapah.
Max had a conversation with the first main character, Fazir.

# Fazir's Scene
Max : Hey, are you Fazir?
Fazir : Yes,is there something you need? 
Max : I’m here just to get information about "him."
Fazir : Hmm, I had already guessed that. Enough with the small talk—let’s duel!
Max : Wow, I really have to duel first to get the information.
(Get into fight.)

(After losing)
Fazir: I’ll be expecting your return.

(After winning)
Max: I won this duel. Hand over the information you know.
Fazir: Damn it… fine, I’ll give you some information about X. But it’s only a part — you’ll need to get the rest from the other three.
Max: Why set it up like this?
Fazir: Because it's necessary to keep X hidden. That way, it becomes a sort of “lesson.”
Max: A "lesson"?
Fazir: First, X is male, around 175cm tall, and slim. That’s all I can tell you.
Max: That’s it? Fine. Thanks anyway.
Fazir: Don’t mention it. Now go. I think the next person you’re looking for is Rane in Learning Point.

# Rane's Scene
Rane: Hey you.
Max: You know who I am?
Rane: Of course. Fazir already told us about you.
Max: Then let’s skip the small talk.
(Get into fight)

(After losing)
Rane: Looks like I’m stronger than you.

(After winning)
Rane: Ha! Didn’t expect you to win.
Max: Then hurry and hand over the info.
Rane: Sure, here you go. Don’t rush.
Max: I still have to do this two more times…
Rane: X’s name is Ben. We call him Ah Ben. Ever since I first met him, I’ve never seen any expression on his face other than his poker face. I remember when we first met, he enthusiastically introduced himself. But that was back then—people change.
Max: You mean X changed?
Rane: Never mind, I was just talking to myself. You should go find the next person, Edeline. She's at the FCI building.
Max: Alright, goodbye. Thanks for the info.
Rane: No need. Good luck.

# Edeline's Scene
Max: Um, hello...
Edeline: Hey! You must be Max! I’m Edeline, nice to meet you!
Max: Haha, nice to meet you too. (Wow, such a pretty and enthusiastic senior.)
Edeline: You’re here for X’s info, right?
Max: Yes, could I trouble you for it? Haha.
Edeline: (Her expression turns fierce) Then... prepare to die!
Max: What?!

(Get into fight)

(After losing)
Edeline: What the hell, you think that strength is enough to challenge me? Get lost.

(After winning)
Edeline: Fxxk! How did I lose?!
Max: Please calm down. Why are you so angry all of a sudden?
Edeline: Damn it, just thinking about that guy X pisses me off! Do you know how much suffering he caused me?
Max: Ahahaha…
Edeline: Whatever, I’ll stick to our agreement. I’ll give you X’s info. He always wears a dark blue dumb-looking hat, and even in hot weather, he wears a black jacket like an idiot. That’s how he’s dressed every time I see him.
Max: Got it. Thanks, senior.
Edeline (expression softens): That’s all I can tell you. You’ll need to find the last piece from Elves at Dewan Tun Canselor (DTC). It was nice meeting you, Max!
Max: Same here, haha… (Women are scary...)

# Elves' Scene
Max: Hello?
Elves: ......
Max: ......
(Get into fight)

(After losing)
Elves: ......

(After winning)
Elves: ......
Max: ......
Elves: I was the first one to meet X. Back when we had to form a group of four for an assignment and were short one person, I saw X sitting alone in a corner of the classroom, so I invited him to join. Sigh… I guess I was too young then to see through people. It was my fault for not having the eye to judge character. But the past is the past. Let me give you the final piece of information — X is currently working at Tekun Mart. If you want the full truth, you’ll have to ask him yourself.
Max: I’ve finally gathered all the info on X! Awesome!

Max collects all the information and returns to Tekun Mart.

# X’s Scene
Max talks to a store staff standing outside.
X: Looks like you got all the intel.
Max: I finally found you. Now hand over the Secret.
X: If you want the Secret, beat me first.
Max: I knew it.
(Get into fight)

(After losing)
X: Come back when you’re stronger.

(After winning)
X: You really want to know the Secret?
Max: Isn’t that obvious? I was hoping this Secret would help me get a 4.0 in my assignment!
X: Alright, the Secret is— “Team up with a top student, do nothing, and let them carry you.”
Max: …That’s just Free Riding!
X: Exactly.
Max: What kind of Secret is that?! All my effort was for nothing!
X: That’s not the point, kid.
Max: What do you mean?
X: The reason they scattered my info was to teach people like you — those hoping to get a 4.0 easily — a lesson. To show that getting a 4.0 isn’t easy.
Max: So that’s why nobody told me outright.
X: I’m sure you understand the truth now. Back then, I was in a team with Elves and the others. For every assignment, I was the Free Rider. They kicked me out after the first semester. That’s when they started calling me X — the “Banned” one. Since then, no one wanted to group with me. I became infamous. Eventually, I ended up in teams full of other Free Riders. That’s when I realized how hard my old teammates had it. I learned my lesson and wanted to atone. So I created this system — making people work to gather my story, to reduce the number of Free Riders out there.
Max: I see. I get it now. I’ll do my part properly and not be a burden to my teammates.
