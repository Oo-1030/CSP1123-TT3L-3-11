# Intro
Max is a foundation freshman exploring his new school, Multimedia University. 
During the WIN week, Max has heard from people around about a legendary senior, X, who has a secret that allows people to get a 4.0 GPA on assignments easily. 
Max is very interested in this and decide to find this senior, X, and get his secret.
Currently, Max learned from others that there are four main characters, all of whom are teammates of X on the assignment.
Fazir at the Haji Tapah.
Rane at the Learning Point.
Edeline at the Faculty of Computing & Informatics (FCI) building.
Elves at the Dewan Tun Canselor (DTC).
Max needs to find them and gets info about X from them.
There is also information about X hidden in various places in the school, so Max must explore this school.

# Start
(Max spawns in MMU Hostel Building 2[HB2].)
Max : Hmmm, interesting rumors. I want to find out the legendary senior, X and get the secret which can get 4.0 on assignment easily. With this secret, my college life will be hassle-free. HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH.
(Max walked toward the stairs and saw a fat guy.)
Fat guy : Wait, I know you are finding X. Right?
Max : WHAT? How you know that.
Fat guy : OH. You're talking to yourself so loudly over there, I can hear you from here.
Max : ......Ok find. What you want to do?
Fat guy : As a senior who started one semester earlier than you, let me teach you how to fight others.
Max : Fight? Why I need to learn it?
Fat guy : Nah, if you can get the info easily, this "GAME" will be very boring.
Max : What you mean this "GAME"? 
Fat guy : ......
Max : ......
Fat guy :Fighting others will help you earn money. Money is essential for acquiring more info about X.
Max : Is that legal?
Fat guy : For sure. Everyone's agreeing willingly, so how could it be illegal?
Max : As long as it's legal, that's fine.
Fat guy : No time to waste, let's begin the fight!
(Get inside fighting tutorial.)

(Tutorial end.)
Fat guy : I have nothing more to teach you. From here on, you'll have to walk the path on your own.
Max : Although it’s all a bit strange, thank you anyway. But—who are you, and why did you teach me all this?
Gok Jun ：My name is Gok Jun. I’m just a senior who happened to pass by—once, I walked the same path as you, in search of X.
Max : Wait, you already know who is X? Why won’t you just tell me who X is, and what the secret is?
Gok Jun : Didn't I already say? That would make this "GAME" way too boring.
Max : ......Ok, bye.
Gok Jun : Farewell. May you overcome all the challenges that lie ahead.

(Exploring.)
On the road, Max encountered an NPC and engaged in battle.
Max passed by Tekun Mart and did a gacha pull inside. 
Max got an item that increases his luck stat.
A Tekun store employee stands outside the shop with a blank expression.
Max arrived at Haji Tapah.
Max had a conversation with the first main character, Fazir.

(In Haji Tapah.)
Max : Hey, are you Fazir?
Fazir : Yes,is there something you need? 
Max : I’m here just to get information about "him."
Fazir : Hmph, I had already guessed that. Enough with the small talk—let’s duel!
Max : Wow, I really have to duel first to get the information.
(Get into fight.)
